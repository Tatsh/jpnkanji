In March 2000, James William Breen assigned ownership of the copyright
of the dictionary files assembled, coordinated and edited by him to the 
The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group
at Monash University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that 
the Group
will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize all
monies received for commercial use of the files for the further
development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography and
electronic dictionaries.

CONDITIONS FOR USING SKIP DATA

Jack Halpern (jack@kanji.org)
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ever since my New Japanese-English Character Dictionary (NJECD) came
out (Kenkyusha 1990, NTC 1993), I have been getting inquiries asking for
permission to use SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) data in 
software products and electronic dictionaries. Below I explain the 
policy of the Kanji Dictionary Publishing Society (KDPS) on how to use 
copyright issues when distributing SKIP data or using it in software 
product or electronic dictionary.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
WHAT IS SKIP?
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Briefly, SKIP is an indexing system that enables the user to locate 
kanji quickly and accurately. The system is extremely convenient because
it can be learned in a very short time, is easy to use, and requires very 
little prior knowledge of kanji. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The central idea of SKIP is the classification of characters into four
major categories on the basis of easy-to-identify geometrical <patterns>:

</P>
</LI>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enclosure
</P>
</LI>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solid
</P>
</LI>
</OL>
Characters belonging to the first three categories are arranged in 
ascending order of hyphenated numerals that represent the number of 
strokes in the <shaded part,> and the number of strokes in the <blank 
part.> See http://www.kanji.org and NJECD front matter for details.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To distribute SKIP data within a group or use it in a commercial 
or non-commercial product, please confirm that you agree to the following 
conditions:

<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COPYRIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION

SKIP data is protected by copyright, copyleft and patent laws. The
copyright holder is Jack Halpern, chief editor of KDPS (the Kanji 
Dictionary Publishing Society). The SKIP data must be protected 
from illegal copying and distribution, using such measures encryption. 
The data must be encrypted if it is to be used in any kind of product, 
including commercial products, software and freeware. The data, or extracts
from it, must not be distributed to a third party, must not be sold as
part of any commercial software package, and must not be incorporated 
in any published dictionary or other printed document without the

The source of SKIP data shall be acknowledged in the information 
screens of the product, and the following disclaimer should appear

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) numbers are derived from 
the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary (Kenkyusha 1990, NTC

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SKIP is a product of seven years of computer-assisted research and 
experimentation on how kanji elements are intuitively perceived in 
terms of their parts. Development work was financed by private funds
and research grants. To enable us to continue to develop useful data
and products, we ask for you cooperation by paying KDPS (the Kanji 
Dictionary Publishing Society) a royalty 0.5% (negotiable) if you are
using the data for a commercial product. Depending on the circumstances,
it is also possible to use SKIP data free of charge or at a lower 
royalty.
