This is a glossary of terms I have encountered in the course of
translating tecnical reports mainly related to concrete stuctures.  
To the best of my knowledge, the terms are correct; some of them have 
been supplied by clients, some rooted out from reliable dictionaries, and 
some from reports on the Internet.  You may or may not find many of the 
terms in this glossary in a standard civil engineering dictionary.  If 
you have additions/corrections or find typos/mistakes, please let me know 
by email at guru@msi.biglobe.ne.jp

This is the first revision to the small glossary I sent to Jim Breen
quite a while ago.  The present version contains about 1080 terms. If I do 
get feedback, I may consider adding more terms.

If you distribute this glossary, please include this readme file. I
would also appreciate an e-mail from you - just to feel the small sense 
of happiness knowing that somebody, somewhere is using the glossary.

Addendum by Jim Breen

The yomikata in this glossary were added by Gururaj using a utility
program. I have checked most of the file, and corrected a few errors.
There are doubtless more, so please tell Guru or me if you find any.
