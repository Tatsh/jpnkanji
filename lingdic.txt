Freeware Japanese/English Dictionary of Linguistics, compiled and
maintained by Francis Bond (bond@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp), formatted to
fit the EDICT format popularized by Jim Breen.  `lingdic' is a
Japanese/English Dictionary of Computational Linguistics, more
specifically a list of Japanese words related to the field of
computational linguistics and their English translations.  The list
ranges from parts-of-speech to terms used in theoretical and
computational linguistics.

Note: in many cases, I have translated technical terms on my own, or
with the help of friends, often there is no known correct form.  If
any users find any errors, or can suggest any improvements, please
email me (preferably with your suggestions instantiated as edict
formatted entries!).

For more information on the format, see the EDICT documentation  It is
basically one of two forms:
kana /English/English/
kanji [kana] /English/

The release of `lingdic' was inspired by Jim Breen's EDICT, a
voluntary project to produce a freely available Japanese/English
Dictionary in machine-readable form.  I use it with MULE and edict.el.

The `lingdic' file is copyright, and is distributed in accordance with
the LINGDIC Licence Statement included at Appendix A.

History
-------

Lingdic started out as a a list of linguistic terms I kept for myself.
I converted it to the format used by Edict, Jim Breen's excellent
public domain dictionary, in late 1994.  I then had a mere 224
entries (note entries are counted as one line i.e. one japanese index
word, there are often multiple translations given).

In mid 1994 I merged it with Satoru Ikehara's yougo list of 220 terms, 
giving a final size of around 350.  

It gradually grew to around 450 terms, mainly through the help of
Minako Kamezaki.  

In February 1995 I merged it with ATR's term list (1326 entries)
giving around 1500 entries (there was a lot of overlap).  

This then grew to 1777 entries, again mainly through the help of
Minako Kamezaki.

In Oct 1996, I merged this list with one given to me by Tim Baldwin
(802 entries) giving 2333 entries.

In Oct 1996, I merged this list with one given to me by Tim Baldwin
(802 entries) giving 2333 entries.

After Oct 1996, I merged this list with one given to me by Tsuneko
"HPSG" Nakazawa (580 entries) giving 2818 entries.

In September 1998 I added some more terms from Satoru Ikehara, and
made many minor corrections in conjunction with the ANLP termbank
project.
